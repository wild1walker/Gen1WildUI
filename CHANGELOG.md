# Changelog

## 1.1.0

Adds **BATTLE INTRO**, from
[gen1recomp-widescreen-battle-intro](https://github.com/ShaneMcGovernIE/gen1recomp-widescreen-battle-intro)
by ShaneMcGovernIE — maintained in this repository from here on, like the two
in Gen1WildQOL. It ships on.

The battle intro's flash plays across the whole window instead of inside a
centred 4:3 square, and the out-of-battle poison pulse with it. Two settings
come with it, on the bundle's own screen rather than the engine's OPTIONS
screen:

| Row | Ships |
|---|---|
| `FLASHLESS INTROS` — every battle opens on the Champion fight's outward spiral | off |
| `BLACK OUTRO` — a battle ends on a slow fade to black instead of the white flash | on |

Both are the mod's own defaults, unchanged.

## 1.0.0

First release. The visual half of the Gen1Wild index, consolidated into one
installable mod.

### Features

Each of these is a row in `OPTION > GEN1WILD UI`, switched on or off by
itself, with its own settings one press of A away:

| Feature | From | Ships |
|---|---|---|
| BACKDROPS | [Gen1Arena](https://github.com/wild1walker/Gen1Arena) | on |
| POKEDEX | [Gen1Dex](https://github.com/wild1walker/Gen1Dex) | on |
| POKEMON BOX | [Gen1BillsBox](https://github.com/wild1walker/Gen1BillsBox) | on |
| PARTY MENU | [Gen1Party](https://github.com/wild1walker/Gen1Party) | on |
| BAG | [Gen1ModernBag](https://github.com/wild1walker/Gen1ModernBag) | on |
| MENU LAYOUT † | [Gen1MenuManager](https://github.com/wild1walker/Gen1MenuManager) | on |
| MOD MANAGER † | [Gen1ModMenu](https://github.com/wild1walker/Gen1ModMenu) | on |

† Carried by Gen1WildQOL as well. With both bundles installed exactly one sets
it up, and its settings live under a shared id so they do not move when the
other bundle is the one that wins.

### Notes

- Nothing here changes what any of these mods do. The source is vendored
  unmodified from each mod's own repository and re-read on every sync.
- `POKEDEX` and `POKEMON BOX` are registered before `PARTY MENU`, which reads
  both when they are present — the same order they resolve in when installed
  separately.
- `MOD MANAGER` sets three of its own rows through the engine's mod manager,
  which writes them unprefixed. The runtime keeps both spellings in step so
  those rows behave the same whether they are set from its quick menu or from
  this bundle's.
- Features in this bundle can still be found by features in
  [Gen1WildQOL](https://github.com/wild1walker/Gen1WildQOL): `Gen151` hangs
  catch hints off `Gen1Dex`, and that lookup crosses the split.
