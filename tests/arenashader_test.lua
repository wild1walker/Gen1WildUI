-- The backdrop is a PHOTOGRAPH, and a photograph must not go through the
-- shade remap.
--
-- Reported three times as "the battle is all greyscale", and the screenshot
-- said it in one line: every pixel of the game screen was one of three DMG
-- shades, and the ONE thing still in colour was the EXP bar -- which is the
-- one thing that calls `love.graphics.setShader()` before it paints
-- (Gen1BattleUI xpbar.lua: "exempt from the palette pass").
--
-- Gen1Arena's paints are substituted INTO the cart's own draw, from a shim on
-- `love.graphics.rectangle`, so whatever shader the caller had bound is still
-- bound when they run.  For a flat fill that changes nothing.  For a FireRed
-- terrain scene it is the whole picture: PaletteFX's shader answers every
-- pixel with one of four palette entries chosen off its RED channel, so the
-- photograph comes back as four greys and the mod reads as if it never ran.
--
-- Two things have to hold, and only one of them is obvious:
--
--   * the shader is DOWN while the art is drawn;
--   * it is back UP afterwards, exactly as it was -- this runs in the middle
--     of the cart's draw, and the shade remap after it is the cart's.  A
--     guard that cleared and left cleared would trade a greyscale backdrop
--     for an uncolourised battle.
