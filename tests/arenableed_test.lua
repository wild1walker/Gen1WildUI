-- The bars around a battle, and the arithmetic that fills them.
--
-- A battle asks the renderer for a WHITE surround: Renderer:endFrame clears
-- the void to PaletteFX.paperShade for any state that sets `letterboxWhite`,
-- and a battle sets it.  That is right for the game it was written for -- the
-- field is white paper, so a white surround makes the paper look like it runs
-- off the screen instead of stopping at a rectangle.
--
-- Put a BACKDROP in the field and the reasoning inverts.  The paper is gone,
-- the surround is the only white left, and instead of disappearing it becomes
-- a bright frame around the art.  A WIDE battle is 304x144 -- very wide and no
-- taller -- so in an ordinary window the bars above and below it are the
-- biggest thing on the screen.  That is the white bar at the top of a wide
-- arena, and Gen1Arena now bleeds the backdrop's own edge into it.
--
-- What can be wrong here is arithmetic: a bar an edge short, a corner left as
-- paper, a rectangle with a negative width.  None of that needs a window, so
-- bleedRects is pure and this drives it directly.

-- Now the bars show the same picture, scaled to COVER the window, each one
-- showing the part that falls where it is.  The property that makes this the
