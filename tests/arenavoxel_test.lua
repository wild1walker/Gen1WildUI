-- Gen1Arena stands down while a voxel mod is drawing the battle.
--
-- A voxel mod draws the battle over the MAP, so there is already a world
-- behind the fight.  A backdrop painted into the field is then a second
-- background nobody asked for -- and worse than redundant: DRAMALESS_SHAPE
-- suppresses the engine's field fill by shimming `love.graphics.rectangle`,
-- which is the same call this mod shims to REPLACE that fill.  Two mods
-- swapping one function for the length of one draw is a coin toss decided by
-- load order.
--
-- The test is the renderer rather than a list of mod ids.  Every fork presents
-- its battle through `Renderer:setWorldOverride`, and the renderer clears that
-- in `beginFrame` -- so a non-nil `worldOverride` is exactly "something
-- replaced the world image on THIS frame", asked of the engine, with no mod
-- named.  A fork with its 3D battles switched off never sets it, and then the
-- backdrop is wanted and drawn.
