-- Headless coverage of BACKDROPS' Gold selection (modules/Gen1Arena/main.lua).
--
-- The drawing needs a window and cannot be tested here.  The SELECTION can,
-- and it is the whole of what is Gen 2-specific: a map header and a battle in,
-- one slot name out.  Everything below drives those pure functions.
--
-- The claim this file is really defending is that no new art was needed.  All
-- twenty backdrops in the pack are FireRed TERRAIN scenes; six of them are
-- named after Kanto bosses only because FireRed assigned them that way, and
-- three of those six (Giovanni's snowfield, Lorelei's ice cave, Agatha's
-- desert) belong to people who are not in Gold, Silver or Crystal at all.  So
-- the tests at the bottom check that every one of the twenty has a home here
-- and that nothing points at a file the package does not carry.
