-- What a backdrop takes away from Gold's battle, and how it is given back.
--
-- Gold draws its battle against PAPER: `drawPanel` opens with `Chrome.clear()`
-- and everything after it is drawn knowing that whatever it does not paint is
-- white.  Put a picture there instead and three of the cart's own assumptions
-- become visible bugs, all three of which were reported from the Crystal cart:
--
--   * every HUD string paints its own paper cell first, because a tilemap
--     cell is opaque -- so the name, the level and the HP numbers each
--     arrived as a white block hugging its own text.
--   * the HP and exp bars are opaque 2bpp sheets, colour 0 and all, so each
--     bar arrived as a white slab with a bar drawn on it.
--   * the pics have holes in them, because the extractor's matte leaks
--     wherever the art runs off the edge of its own frame -- so you could see
--     the arena through the player's shirt.
--
-- The first fix put PLATES behind the HUD blocks and was rejected on sight:
-- "there shouldn't be the big black or white box behind all that stuff.  Look
-- gen 1 looks much cleaner."  So the assertions here are about paper being
-- TAKEN AWAY rather than added -- and the one place it is still added, inside
-- the pic, is asserted to be the pic's own shape and not a rectangle.
--
-- The pic measurement is exercised for real rather than stubbed -- the
-- graphics stub below carries enough canvas for `readPic` to read an
-- ImageData back -- because which pixels are a hole is the half of that fix
-- with somewhere to go wrong.

-- ---- the cut-out is asked for in the draw and BUILT between frames

-- 0.32.62 shipped it on and it broke a battle over a backdrop: flipped on
-- iOS, a crash on Android.  0.32.65 switched it off.  The cause was never the
-- cut-out itself -- it was building one INSIDE the draw: a readback binds a
-- scratch canvas and `newImage` makes a whole new texture, both with the
-- battle's canvas bound.  picPaperImage did the same readback but bailed
-- before `newImage` for any pic with no holes, which is every cart pic, so it
-- almost never reached the texture and the difference never showed.
--
-- What this pins is the SPLIT that fixes it, because the split is the whole
-- of the fix and it is invisible in the output: the draw's `cutoutFor` must
-- never build, and `buildQueuedCutouts` -- called from `core.update`, where
-- nothing is bound -- must be the only thing that does.
